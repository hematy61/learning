# Programming paradigms

Programming paradigm is a way of programming that involves different styles of organizing, structuring, and writing code to solve a specific problem. The word paradigm is derived from the Greek word "paradeigma" which means "example" or "pattern". However, in the context of programming languages , the term paradigm means set of design principles that defines the program structure.
There are several programming paradigms, each with its own unique approach, syntax, and methodology, and understanding these paradigms will help programmer to choose the best approach to solve any given problem.

The programming paradigms can be classified into two main categories and a few sub-categories:

- Imperative paradigm
  - Structured programming
  - Procedural programming
  - Object-oriented programming
- Declarative paradigm
  - Functional programming
  - Logic programming
  - Mathematical programming
  - Reactive programming

Each programming paradigm addresses a different set of principles and rules that the programming language must follow. The programming paradigms are enforced by the programming language compiler during the compilation process. Some programming languages support multiple programming paradigms, while others support only one. The first group are called multi-paradigm programming languages, while the second group are called single-paradigm programming languages.

## The Definition of Programming Paradigm

The programming paradigm is a set of principles, rules, and guidelines that define the structure of a programming language. The programming paradigm does not enforce any specific syntax or methodology, but it does define the structure of the programming language.

## Imperative Paradigm

The Imperative programming paradigm is a programming style that describes the sequence of operations that are performed to change the state of the program. The central idea of this paradigm is to provide a step-by-step process, which outlines exactly how to achieve the desired outcome. In imperative programming, the programmer has to explicitly specify each statement in details. Each statement directs what to do and how to do it.
Imperative programming uses simple and direct commands, such as assigning values, looping, or branching to control the program flow, and modify the program state. An imperative program focuses on how the problem should be solved, rather than abstracting the solution. Imperative programming is very useful for low-level programming tasks or when efficiency is important, such as in device drivers or operating systems. However, it can have readability and maintainability issues as programs tend to be longer and more complex, which can make it harder to reason about the program's behavior over time.

Here is an example of imperative paradigm in Python:

```python
# Imperative paradigm example in Python

students = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
grades = {}

for student in students:
    grade = int(input(f"Enter grade for {student}: "))
    grades[student] = grade

print("Grades:")
for student, grade in grades.items():
    print(f"{student}: {grade}")
```

In this example, we have used imperative paradigm to:

- Define a list of students.
- Create an empty dictionary to store grades.
- Loop through the list of students and ask the user for their grade, then store it in the dictionary.
- Print out the grades for each student.

Imperative programming involves explicitly specifying how the program should carry out a sequence of steps or actions to achieve a desired outcome. In this example, we have used a series of statements to describe the steps necessary to gather and display the grades for a group of students.

!!! note
    The imperative paradigm directs **what** to do and **how** to do it.

### Structured Programming

In the early days of computer programming, most programs comprised a single procedure with many lines of code. Program languages did not have IF statements or FOR or WHILE loops. To repeat sections of the code, 'goto' statements (e.g. goto 50 that directed flow to line 50) were used, and the overuse of these constructs resulted in so-called 'spaghetti code', where program flow switched back and forth, making the code very hard to follow and maintain. The structured programming paradigm was developed by Edsger Dijkstra in the late 1960s to address this problem.
In structured programming, all programs are made up of control structures:

- Sequence: Statements that are executed in sequence, one after another.
- Selection: A statement or block of code that is executed if the results of a logical test are true. Selection is usually expressed with keywords such as: `if..then..else..endif`.
- Iteration: A statement or block of code that is executed while a logical condition is true, until a logical condition is true or for a given number of times. Iteration is usually expressed with keywords such as: `while`, `repeat`, `for`, `do..until`.

### Procedural Programming

Procedural programming is based on the structured approach but goes one step further in terms of breaking long programs down into a set of subroutines. However, Procedural Programming is a programming paradigm that involves creating procedures (also known as functions or subroutines) and organizing code into a series of steps, where each step calls the appropriate procedure to perform a specific task. It is well-suited for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller tasks or subroutines.

!!!
    The programming language C is an example of a language that is purely procedural.

!!! Note Procedures
    A procedure is a named block of code that contain a series of computational steps to be carried out in the order specified by the programmer. The procedure must be called in order to be executed.
    In computer science theory, a distinction is made between procedures that return values and those that don't. The term **function** is used for a procedure that returns one or more values, and the term **procedure** is used for a piece of code that does something, but does not return any values. In Isaac Computer Science, the more generic term subroutine is used when referring to a named block of code where the distinction between whether or not a value is returned is unimportant.
    A well-defined procedural program should have a **single point of entry**. In many programming languages, this is a subroutine called **main** which is called automatically when the program is run. The main subroutine will be made up of calls to other subroutines that carry out the program's key tasks. These subroutines in turn will call other subroutines. When subroutines are given **meaningful identifiers** (names), the main program flow can be self-documenting.
    Below you will find an example of a main subroutine, expressed in pseudo code, that has been specified using the procedural paradigm. The names of subroutines that are called (from the main subroutine) make it clear to the reader what the program will do.

    ```pseudo
    PROCEDURE main()
    user_name = get_user_name()
    finished = False
    
    WHILE finished == False
        question = generate_question()
        answer = get_answer(question)

        user_answer = ask_question(question)
        correct = check_answer(answer, user_answer)
        show_result(user_name, correct)

        finished = check_if_finished()
    ENDWHILE
    ENDPROCEDURE
    ```

The procedural programming paradigm encourages the developer to start by considering **'what a system does'**, and is also sometimes referred to as **top-down** problem-solving: you start with a large problem and break it down into smaller problems until each subproblem is a discrete task that can be solved.

```python
# Example: Calculating the sum of two numbers

def add_numbers(a, b):
    """
    This function takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.
    """
    return a + b

# Ask the user for two numbers
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Call the add_numbers function and print the result
result = add_numbers(num1, num2)
print("The sum is:", result)
```

In this example, we define a function called `add_numbers` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum. We then ask the user to enter two numbers, call the `add_numbers` function with these numbers as arguments, and print the result.

Procedural programming is often used for tasks such as file input/output, mathematical calculations, and data processing. It is also widely used in the development of system-level software, such as device drivers and operating systems.

One potential downside of procedural programming is that it can become difficult to manage as the program grows larger and more complex. As a result, many programmers opt for object-oriented programming (OOP) or functional programming (FP) paradigms instead.

Pros of procedural programming:

- **Easy to understand:** Procedural programming follows a linear approach with a clear flow of control from one function to another, making it easier to understand and debug.
- **Efficient memory usage:** Procedural programming methods require less memory usage, and it's much easier to write compactly and efficiently when using this approach.
- **Code reusability:** Functions created in procedural programming can be reused in multiple parts of a program, which makes the code more efficient and reduces development time.
- **Good for small programs:** Procedural programming is best suited for developing small to medium-sized applications because it is simpler to learn and to implement.
- **Easy to learn:** It is comparatively easier to learn procedural programming concepts when compared to other programming paradigms like OOP, functional programming, etc.
- **Simple design:** Procedural programs have a clear, straightforward design, which makes it easier to design, write and maintain code.
- **Easy to document:** With clear step-by-step procedures, procedural programming is easy to document and understand, which makes it easier for other developers to collaborate on your projects.

Cons of procedural programming:

- **Lack of abstraction:** Procedural programming may lack the abstraction required to manage large, complex projects and may result in difficulty when trying to scale projects.

- **Not suitable for all problems:** Procedural programming works well for problems that can be broken down into smaller tasks or subroutines, but it may not be suitable for all types of problems.

- **Code duplication:** When code is divided into various functions or subroutines, some code may be duplicated across these sections, resulting in a larger codebase that is more difficult to maintain.

- **Difficulty in code modification:** Modifying or extending a procedural program can be difficult, especially if the program is large and complex. In such cases, it may be challenging to keep track of all the functions and their interdependencies.

- **Global data:** It can be difficult to manage global data in large procedural programs since the data is usually accessible by all functions within the program, which can lead to errors when multiple functions modify the same data.

- **Total dependence on functions:** Since the program relies solely on functions, the program's quality and efficiency are directly proportional to the quality and efficiency of the underlying functions.

- **Limited reusability:** Functions created in procedural programming may not be widely usable in other programming languages or paradigms, leading to reduced code reusability

### Structured Programming vs Procedural Programming

Structured programming and procedural programming are both programming paradigms that emphasize the use of procedures, or subroutines, to organize code and make it more modular. However, there are some key differences between the two:

Structured programming places a stronger emphasis on the use of structured control flow constructs, such as loops and conditionals, to control the flow of the program and avoid the use of unstructured control flow constructs, such as GOTO statements. Procedural programming, on the other hand, is less strict about the use of structured constructs and allows for more flexibility in control flow.

Structured programming places a stronger emphasis on top-down design, which involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts, and then gradually refining the solution from the top down. Procedural programming is less strict about the design process and allows for more flexibility in the order in which procedures are written.

Structured programming is often associated with high-level languages, such as Pascal and Ada, that were developed in the 1970s and 1980s. Procedural programming is associated with a wider range of languages, including C, Fortran, and COBOL.

Structured programming is often used in conjunction with other programming paradigms, such as object-oriented programming, to provide a more well-rounded approach to software development. Procedural programming is often used in more specialized applications, such as scientific computing and system programming.

Overall, while there is some overlap between structured programming and procedural programming, they are distinct programming paradigms with their own strengths and weaknesses. Structured programming is more focused on code organization and control flow, while procedural programming is more focused on the use of procedures to encapsulate functionality.

Here are some examples of structured programming and procedural programming:

An example of structured programming might be a program that calculates the average of a set of numbers. The program could be divided into several procedures, such as one to read in the numbers, one to calculate the sum of the numbers, and one to calculate the average. The program would use structured control flow constructs, such as loops and conditionals, to control the flow of the program and avoid unstructured control flow.

An example of procedural programming might be a program that sorts a list of names in alphabetical order. The program might use a single procedure to implement the sorting algorithm, and would be less strict about the use of structured control flow constructs. The program might also be written in C, which is a procedural programming language that is commonly used in system programming.

### Object-Oriented Paradigm

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on the use of objects and their interactions to design and implement computer programs. In this paradigm, everything is treated as an object with its own properties and behaviors. OOP is based on four major principles:

- **Encapsulation**: This principle means that data and the methods that manipulate that data are bundled together as a single unit called an object. Encapsulation provides data privacy and security for the object, preventing accidental modification by other parts of the program.

- **Inheritance**: This principle allows objects to inherit properties and behaviors from other objects known as parent or superclass. Inheritance enables code reusability and reduces the amount of code required to be written.

- **Polymorphism**: This principle allows objects to take on different forms or shapes based on the context in which they are used. Polymorphism provides a way to perform a single action in different ways.

- **Abstraction**: This principle focuses on the essential features of an object that are important to its context, hiding irrelevant details. Abstraction makes it easier to manage complexity by breaking a system down into smaller, more manageable parts.

The use of OOP allows for modular and reusable code, easier maintenance and modification, and better organization and structure of programs. Popular programming languages like Java, Python, and C++ support object-oriented programming.

OOP is generally considered an imperative programming paradigm. In imperative programming, developers write instructions that tell the computer what to do and how to do it. In OOP, programmers define objects (which encapsulate both data and the methods that operate on that data) and then tell these objects to perform certain actions through method calls.

While OOP languages can support declarative features, the core idea behind OOP — defining classes with methods, creating objects from those classes, and interacting with those objects — is imperative in nature. The programmer specifies "how" to do something by writing methods that implement specific behaviors.

So, while OOP can incorporate elements of both imperative and declarative programming, it is primarily considered an imperative paradigm.

## Declarative Paradigm

The declarative paradigm is a programming paradigm that expresses the logic of a computation without explicitly describing its control flow. Instead of defining step-by-step instructions for the computer to follow, as in an imperative paradigm, a declarative paradigm describes the desired outcome and leaves the implementation details to the system.

In a declarative paradigm, the programmer specifies **what should be done, rather than how it should be done**. This is achieved by using high-level abstractions such as functions, relations, and logic. These abstractions allow the programmer to describe the problem domain in a natural and concise way, and the system can then use this description to automatically generate the code needed to solve the problem.

One advantage of the declarative paradigm is that it can make code easier to read and understand. By focusing on the problem domain rather than implementation details, programmers can write more concise and expressive code. Additionally, declarative programs can often be easier to parallelize, since the system can reason about the dependencies between different parts of the program.

However, declarative programming is not suitable for all types of problems. It can be challenging to express certain types of control flow in a declarative way, and declarative programs can be less efficient than imperative ones. As with any programming paradigm, it's important to choose the right tool for the job.

Here is an example of declarative paradigm in SQL:

Suppose we have a table employees with columns id, name, department, and salary. We want to select all employees who work in the IT department and earn more than $50,000 per year.

In SQL, we can express this declaratively by writing a query:

```sql
SELECT name, salary FROM employees WHERE department = 'IT' AND salary > 50000;
```

This expresses what we want to accomplish, rather than how to accomplish it, i.e, we want to select employees based on some criteria, rather than instructing the database on how to perform these operations.

Here is another example in Python:

Suppose we have a list of strings and we want to create a new list with only the strings that have a length of 5 characters.

In Python, we can express this declaratively using a list comprehension:

```python
strings = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "kiwi", "watermelon"]
result = [word for word in strings if len(word) == 5]
```

This expresses what we want to accomplish, rather than how to accomplish it, i.e, we want to filter strings based on their length, rather than writing a for loop and checking the length of each string inside the loop. Here we used a list comprehension to filter the strings based on the condition and create a new list with the desired elements.

Methods like `filter()` and `map()` are also used to express the logic of a computation without explicitly describing its control flow. In other words, they allow us to express the desired outcome and leave the implementation details to the system.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print(even_numbers)
```

### Functional Paradigm

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of pure functions to accomplish tasks. In this paradigm, functions are treated as first-class citizens, which means that they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from functions.

!!!
    Functional programming is a declarative paradigm. In a declarative paradigm, the programmer specifies what the program should do, rather than how to do it. In the case of functional programming, the emphasis is on defining functions that take input and produce output, without specifying the exact steps to be taken to produce that output. This is in contrast to imperative programming, which focuses on defining the steps the program should take to produce output.

One of the key characteristics of functional programming is **immutability**, which means that once a value is assigned, it cannot be changed. This makes it easier to reason about the behavior of a program and can help prevent bugs caused by unexpected changes to variables.

Another important aspect of functional programming is the **avoidance of side effects**, which are changes to the state of the program that occur outside the function being executed. This means that functions are designed to be **pure**, with no side effects, making them easier to test and reason about.

Functional programming languages often have built-in support for many common functional programming concepts, such as **recursion**, **higher-order functions**, and **closures**. Some popular functional programming languages include Haskell, Lisp, and Erlang.

One of the benefits of functional programming is that it can lead to more concise and maintainable code, since pure functions are easier to reason about and can be tested in isolation. However, it may not always be the best choice for all situations, and some developers may find it more difficult to learn initially due to its emphasis on mathematical concepts and abstraction.

There are several key principles of functional programming, including:

- **Pure functions**: A pure function is a function that does not have any side effects and returns the same output value for a given input value. This means that pure functions are deterministic and do not modify any state outside their own scope.

- **Immutability**: In functional programming, data is immutable, which means that it cannot be modified once it has been created. Instead, new data structures are created each time a modification is made, and the original data structure is left unchanged.

- **Higher-order functions**: Functions in functional programming can take other functions as arguments or return functions as values. This allows for more powerful and flexible abstractions that can be reused in different contexts.

- **Recursion**: Recursion is a common programming technique in functional programming, where a function is defined in terms of itself. This allows for elegant and concise solutions to complex problems, particularly when working with data structures.

- **Referential transparency**: A function is referentially transparent if it can be replaced by its return value without affecting the behavior of the program. This means that referentially transparent functions can be easily composed and reasoned about.

- **Modular design (Function Composition)**: Functional programming encourages modular design, where small, reusable functions are combined to create more complex programs. This can lead to more maintainable code and easier testing.

These principles are designed to promote simplicity, modularity, and expressiveness in functional programs, and can lead to more maintainable and scalable code that is easier to reason about and test.

## Component-Oriented Paradigm

Component-Oriented Programming (COP) is a paradigm that emphasizes the separation of concerns in terms of behavior. It's a method used in software development where pre-made components, each with a specific purpose, are selected and combined to create a software system.

Here are some key points about Component-Oriented Programming:

**Components:** In COP, a component is a unit of software that is independently replaceable and upgradeable. It encapsulates the behavior and data into a single unit and exposes a set of interfaces. Components are typically packaged in a way that makes them easy to deploy into a system.

**Reusability:** One of the main advantages of COP is the ability to reuse components across different systems. This can significantly speed up development time, as developers can use pre-made components instead of writing all code from scratch.

**Separation of Concerns:** Each component in COP is designed to perform a specific task. This separation of concerns makes components easier to understand, test, and maintain.

**Encapsulation:** Components hide their internal details and expose their functionality through interfaces. This encapsulation ensures that components can be used without needing to understand their internal workings.

**Interoperability:** Components can be written in different programming languages and run on different systems, as long as they adhere to the same interface.

**Composition:** In COP, complex systems are built by composing together simpler components. This composition can often be done in a declarative way, without writing code.

C# and .NET are examples of technologies that support component-oriented programming. In .NET, components can be created as assemblies (DLL or EXE files) that expose their functionality through .NET interfaces. These components can then be reused across different .NET applications.

### What is Interoperability?

Interoperability in the context of Component-Oriented Programming (COP) refers to the ability of different components, potentially written in different programming languages or running on different systems, to interact and work together.

Here's an example of interoperability in a .NET environment:

Let's say you have a component written in C# that performs some complex calculations. This component exposes a method called `Calculate` that takes in some parameters and returns a result.

```csharp
public class CalculationComponent
{
    public double Calculate(double a, double b)
    {
        // Perform some complex calculations...
        return result;
    }
}
```

Now, you're working on a new project in Visual Basic .NET, and you want to use this calculation component. Because both C# and Visual Basic .NET compile to the same Intermediate Language (IL) and run on the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR), you can use the C# component in your Visual Basic .NET code without any issues.

```vb
Dim calcComponent As New CalculationComponent()
Dim result As Double = calcComponent.Calculate(5, 10)
```

In this example, the `CalculationComponent` written in C# is being used in a Visual Basic .NET application. This is possible because of the interoperability provided by the .NET platform and the Component-Oriented nature of the .NET languages. The component encapsulates some functionality (the complex calculation), and exposes an interface (the `Calculate` method) that can be used by other components, regardless of the language they are written in.
