 * AIntersectionDistanceFromHead = distance of the head of the first list from the intersection point

 *
 * The idea is to take two pointers, x and y, initially pointing to the head of the first and
 * second lists. Then advance both pointers at the same pace until they meet at a common node.
 * When x reaches its end, redirect it to the head of the second list. When y reaches its end,
 * turn it to the head of the first list. The node where x meets y is the intersection node.

 * Time complexity : O( m + n )
 * Auxiliary Space:  O(1)
