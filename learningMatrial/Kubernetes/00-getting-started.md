# Fundamentals of Kubernetes

1. **Operating System (OS):**
   - The operating system is software that serves as the interface between computer hardware and the user. It manages hardware resources, schedules tasks, and provides various services and utilities to enable software applications to run.

2. **Kernel:**
   - The kernel is the core part of the operating system that provides fundamental services such as process management, memory management, device management, and system calls handling. It operates in a privileged mode, meaning it has direct access to hardware and system resources.

3. **OS Kernel:**
   - This term simply combines the two above, emphasizing that the kernel is a part of the operating system. It's a way of referring to the kernel within the context of the operating system.
