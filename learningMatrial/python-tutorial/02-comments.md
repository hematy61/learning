# Comments in Python

There are many ways to write comments in python.

**Single line comments**
The most common way is to use the `#` symbol. This is a single line comment. For example:

```python
# this is a comment
```

**Multi-line comments**
The first way to write a multi-line comment is to use triple quotes. For example:

```python
""" this is a multi-line comment
this is the second line of the comment
this is the third line of the comment
"""
```

Another way to write a multi-line comment is to use the `#` symbol. For example:

```python
# this is the first line of the comment
# this is the second line of the comment
# this is the third line of the comment
```

**Inline comments**
You can also write comments inline. For example:

```python
print("hello world") # this is an inline comment
```

**Docstrings**
Docstrings are used to document your code. They are also used to generate documentation for your code.

**Docstrings in variables**
You can also write docstrings in variables. For example:

```python
my_variable = "hello world"
"""This is a docstring"""
```

**Docstrings in functions**
You can also write docstrings in functions. For example:

```python
def my_function():
    """This is a docstring"""
    print("hello world")
```

**Docstrings in function arguments**
You can also write docstrings in function arguments. To document arguments, you can use the `:param` keyword. For example:

```python
def my_function(my_argument):
    """This is a docstring

    :param my_argument: this is a docstring for the my_argument argument
    """
    print("hello world")
```

**Docstrings in function methods**
You can also write docstrings in function methods. For example:

```python
def my_function():
    """This is a docstring"""
    def my_method():
        """This is a docstring"""
        print("hello world")
```

**Docstrings in classes**
You can also write docstrings in classes. For example:

```python
class MyClass:
    """This is a docstring"""
    def __init__(self):
        pass
```

**Docstrings in class methods**
You can also write docstrings in methods. For example:

```python
class MyClass:
    """This is a docstring for the MyClass class"""
    def my_method(self):
        """
        This is a docstring for the my_method method
        :param self: this is a docstring for the self argument
        """
        print("hello world")
```
