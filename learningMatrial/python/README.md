# Learning Python

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to learning Python! This repository contains code, notes, and resources that I have collected while studying Python, with the aim of becoming a proficient developer.

The main topics covered in this repository include:

- Basic syntax and control flow
- Data types, structures, and manipulation
- Functions and modules
- Object-oriented programming
- File handling and I/O operations
- Web development with Flask

For an enhanced markdown preview experience, I recommend installing the Markdown Preview Enhanced plugin for VSCode. This plugin adds more features such as math equations, table of contents, diagrams, and more.
  
To use this plugin with markdown files in this repository, you will need to open the file in the editor, right-click on the editor, and select "Open Preview to the Side" or press Ctrl + Shift + V on Windows or Cmd + Shift + V on Mac to open the Markdown Preview Enhanced.

You can also run the code snippets in the enhanced preview mode by clicking the "Run Code Chunk" button at the top left of the preview window, or press the Ctrl + Alt + Enter keys.

Feel free to use this repository as a learning resource, or as a reference for your own Python projects. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please don't hesitate to create an issue or pull request. Happy coding!
